    "description": "If you're confused as to why there is an almost 2 month difference between the release date of some Reitaisai 8 albums, it is because that on March 11th, 2011 Japan was hit by the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The most severe earthquake in Japan's history, it was a magnitude 9.1 and the resultant tsunami caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Because of this event, Reitaisai 8 was canceled and later rescheduled for May.",
