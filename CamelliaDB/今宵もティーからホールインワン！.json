    "description": "From the albums page, 月葉 is credited with doing the vocals (ボーカル), but Nanahira is credited with doing the... voice (ボイス)? I don't really know what the difference is but from what I can tell there are in fact two distinct voices sing the lyrics in the song. Maybe the distinction is just because Nanahira only really did the shouty bits? Idk, it's all vocals in my book. If someone could let me know what the difference is I would appreciate it.",
