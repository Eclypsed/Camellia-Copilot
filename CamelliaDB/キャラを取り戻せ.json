    "description": "The original song is credited as おてんば恋娘の冒険 which is Cirno's theme from 東方花映塚　～ Phantasmagoria of Flower View, however on the album's page the game credited is 東方紅魔郷　～ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. Idk if this is a mistake, but I feel like the author was more likely to make a mistake on the game, then a mistake on the original song so I decided to put 東方花映塚　～ Phantasmagoria.",
