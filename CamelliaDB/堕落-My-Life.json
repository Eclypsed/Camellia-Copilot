    "description": "1分間コンピ was a compilation album of about 68 tracks, each being around a minute in length. Some tracks were Vocaloid, some had standard vocals, some didn't feature any vocals at all.  I couldn't identify any one specific label, circle, or individual that was in charge of producing the album, the closest I could find was that かごめP mastered the album.",
