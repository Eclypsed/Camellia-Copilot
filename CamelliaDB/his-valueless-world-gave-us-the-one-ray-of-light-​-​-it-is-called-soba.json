    "description": "Camellia has also refrenced the song as \"This valueless world gave us the one ray of light -​-​- it is called soba\". Note the T at the begining, making the first word \"This\" and not \"his\". However, the official album page lists the song starting with just \"his\". The album's page on bandcamp also lists an incorrect release date; instead of October 26th it is listed as the 27th.",
