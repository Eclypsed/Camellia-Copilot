    "description": "Mazare Dance was produced for 江州盆ダンス2017 and was performed live by Camellia and the other aforementioned vocalists/performers. Mazare Dance marks Camellia's second and only other appearance at 江州盆ダンス.  The Mazare Festival was established in 2016 as a combination of the Lake Biwa Otsu Summer Festival and the Hamaotsu Summer Festa, which had been held separately in Otsu City. \"Mazare\" is a coined word that combines \"交ざる (Mazaru)\", which means people gather and interact, and \"マザーレイク (mazareiku)\", which means Lake Biwa.",
