    "description": "What is Ninja Slayer? from the Japanese Ninja Slayer FAN WIKI: \"A cyberpunk ninja action novel that rocks the United States. The original authors are American Bradley Bond and Philip Ninja Moses. Currently, the Japanese translation version is serialized on Twitter by the translation team that has obtained the Japanese translation rights, and it is gradually gaining popularity. In addition to being serialized in real time on the Twitter account, volunteers have also organized a summary of Togetter. It was published as a book in 2012. In 2013, it was made into an audio drama and comicalized, and in 2014, it was made into a figure, and in 2015, an anime was aired.\" (Google Translate tryin its best)  Talk about an unknown song. This album appears to be Ninja Slayer fan work and it features music specifically from 18 different Vocaloid/UTAU producers, but no actual Vocaloids or UTAUs. I couldn't identify any one specific label, circle, or individual that was incharge of producing the album. The vocalist(s), ネコネコカワイイ (romanji: Neko Neko Kawaii), are apparently \"A popular idol duo unit consisting of two Oilandroids Nekochan (Hiromi Igarashi) and Kawaiiko (Yumi Uchiyama).\" Please don't ask what an Oilandroid is. There are clearly vocals in the song, and I can only find a vocal credit to ネコネコカワイイ, but from what I can tell these are characters in the Ninja Slayer series, so I guess maybe these vocals were done by the voice actors. But then the Ninja Slayer anime didn't come out until 3 years after this album, so it's not like the vocals could have been sampled from the anime, fuck I don't even know if they were in the anime. So then did they already have voice actors for these characters? Was the idol group formed way before the anime came out? Where did Camellia source the vocals? I don't know. Someone send help, my head hurts.  From what I can tell the title of the song is full of refrences to the novel. For example, MEDITECH could be a refrence to Omura Meditech, an Aircraft manufactuer in novel, I think. And apparently コネコカワイイ・ジャンプ (Neko Neko Kawaii Jump) is an... inhuman dance move(?) that ネコネコカワイイ is known for doing(????). I really know nothing about Ninja Slayer and I'm too lazy to research such an incredibly obscure fandom just to understand the title and origin of this track. Camellia must have been a fan of the novel at some point or something, but from what I have found, other than a link at the very bottom of his Activity page, he has made no other refrences or mentions of this song or Ninja Slayer. Either that or the album producers just needed to find another Vocaloid producer to put on the album. You can find out more about the series at the Ninja Slayer fandom page.  Y'know, I kinda hated this track at the start, but after way too many listens it's starting to grow on me. Neko Neko Kawaiii... Neko Neko Kawaii...",
